/*
PlayerAttack
    Used to trigger the attacking of the player
    and how the weapon fires

    Things are needed to improve:
        The script is hard-coded. It only provides attack
        to a fixed projectile with a fixed component/perk.

        This script/other scripts are needed to be flexible
        for projectiles/weapons with different perk and
        property.

        Components that are needed to be flexible with:
            Chosen Bomb/Weapon
            Perk
            Explosion (OK)

            Different behaviours caused by a perk (i.e. cluster bomb) (OK)
