Super Soda Bomber is based from a GameJam 2D Shoot-em-up game conceptualized by FrancisClements, and it is currently remaking in the works by a group of 2nd year students from Holy Angel University located at the Philippines.

It's a 2 semester-long project and a major requirement for our two subjects: 6APPDEV (Application Development and Emerging Technologies) and 6INTROGAME (Introduction to Game Design and Development) on Academic Year 2020 - 2021.
